# Dendrite.ai Data Science Internship Screening Task

This repository contains the solution for the Dendrite.ai Data Science Internship Screening Task. The project demonstrates the creation of a machine learning pipeline that automates key stages of the machine learning process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The pipeline is implemented using the **Scikit-learn** library.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that handles the following tasks:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format for training models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generating meaningful features from the data to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- **Matplotlib** (Optional): For visualizing the data and results.

## Features

- Automated data preprocessing to handle missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- Feature engineering methods for creating new features that could enhance model accuracy.
- Model training using popular algorithms like **RandomForestClassifier**, **RandomForestRegressor**,**Logistic Regression**, **GBTClassifier**, **GBTRegressor**, **LinearRegression**, **LogisticRegression**, **RidgeRegression**, **LassoRegression**, **ElasticNetRegression**, **XGBoost**, **DecisionTreeRegressor**, **DecisionTreeClassifier**, **SVM**, **SGD**, **KNN**, **extra_random_trees**, **neural_network**.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
